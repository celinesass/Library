# Prelude Libraries

Prelude maintains a collection of open-source libraries that interact with our products, [Build](https://docs.prelude.org/docs/build) and [Detect](https://docs.prelude.org/docs/the-basics).

Libraries are organized by language and categorized by:

* Probe
* SDK

> There is a special library called the [Prelude CLI](https://docs.prelude.org/docs/prelude-cli), which supports all Build and Detect functionality.

## Probe

A [probe](https://docs.prelude.org/docs/probes) is an ephemeral endpoint process that requires no special privileges and no installation. Probes have one duty: accept security tests from Detect, execute them, and respond with the result.

## SDK

A Software Development Kit (SDK) allows you to build your own tooling against the Prelude Service API.
