## Prelude Libraries

Prelude maintains a collection of open-source libraries that are used to power our products:


<ol>
          <li><a href="https://www.preludesecurity.com/products/operator">Prelude Operator</a>: Perform realistic security assessments on security systems</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.preludesecurity.com/products/build">Prelude Build</a>: Security test authoring</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.preludesecurity.com/products/detect">Prelude Detect</a>: Continuous security testing</li>
</ol>


These libraries are designed for security engineers, DevOps engineers, software engineers and IT analysts. They allow you to download, use and edit Prelude's core services in whatever format you're most comfortable with.
