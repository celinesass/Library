# Hades

> One of Chopin's 24 Preludes. Hades is considered by many to be the most difficult of the Chopin preludes.[2] Hans von BÃ¼low dubbed this prelude "Hades." It was composed between 1836 and 1839, published in 1839 and dedicated to Camille Pleyel who commissioned the opus 28 preludes for 2,000 francs.
